1.	The best way I've advanced my career is by changing companies.

跳槽可能是你职业发展的最好选择。

这里的advanced可能指前进和提高，可以认为是说职业发展。

为什么会产生这样的情况呢？

第一，互联网永远缺人。

互联网进化的速度太快了，我们在疯狂的淘汰掉无法跟着行业进行进化的人，因为这种进化，所以我们永远需要掌握新技术的人。技术的更新决定了人的稀缺。

比如说前几年电商出现了，我们就需要大量的数据科学家来分析用户行为，之后短视频出现了我们需要大量的推荐系统工程师来，更不要提人工智能、区块链等等，技术总是不等人的，所以人永远是稀缺的。

第二，公司永远无法知道你值多少钱。

在公司内我们是很难衡量一个人的价值的，即便我们能明白有些人确实比其他人更强，也很难用一个快速的机制来反映到你的待遇上。

大家想过程序员的薪资来自于哪里吗，你的薪资可能是因为你开发了某个产品，而某个产品是否赚钱其实有很多因素，比如它能否很好的被设计，被销售等等。

所以程序员距离公司的直接受益太远了。

离收益最近的职业典型的就是销售，大家知道很多销售是拿提成的，就是卖出去多少，返回给你百分比。

而程序员的功劳到公司赚钱，其实很难衡量，这也导致公司并不知道你值多少钱。

第三，你的价值是由整个行业的供需决定的，并不简单的由你和你的公司决定。

从公司的角度出发，公司是按照自己的收益给你付出的工资，并不能，也很难仅仅因为行业里你的职业工资上涨了，就快速上涨你的工资，这需要很长的反应时间。

从行业的角度出发，某些产品或者某些职业突然吃香是很可能的，也是因为互联网在不断更新发展，行业，或者说行业里因为这种发展，导致某些人才稀缺，而工资提高，行业也没有错。

你自己呢，希望提高工资，而公司的反应肯定是落后于行业的反应速度的，所以你希望提高工资，自然也没错。

唯一的解决方案，就是跳槽而已。

最后，我并不是鼓励大家随意跳槽。

我给大家几个关于跳槽的建议：

第一：随时做好跳槽的准备，你需要经常review自己的简历，这不仅仅是为了跳槽，也可以通过这种方式来校验自己，你到底学会了什么，你，相比去年的自己，提高了什么？如果你的简历没有什么可更新的，跳槽可能都无法挽救你了。

第二：永远给自己工作外的学习时间，我们假设时间需要分为几类，生活必要时间，娱乐时间，工作时间。生活必要时间比如吃饭睡觉，但是娱乐时间和工作时间，请压榨自己。

娱乐时间就不说了，但是绝对不鼓励大家没有娱乐时间，没有娱乐你是撑不下去的。

工作时间怎么压榨呢，这里不是说大家要学会摸鱼，而是学会快速工作的方法，你需要在工作中反复思考怎么样才能更高效的工作。

那压榨出来的时间干嘛呢，学习，回到上一条，随时为跳槽做准备。

那如果你说，我真的实在压榨不出来时间的了，那我从我个人的经验角度，很遗憾的告诉你，你可能不适合这一行，请压榨一些时间思考换行的问题。

以上就是关于醉酒程序员的第一条建议。

2.	Technology stacks don't really matter because there are like 15 basic patterns of software engineering in my field that apply. I work in data so it's not going to be the same as webdev or embedded. But all fields have about 10-20 core principles and the tech stack is just trying to make those things easier, so don't fret overit.

技术栈并不重要，因为每个领域都有固定的几种模式。

每个技术领域都有10～20个核心原则，并且技术栈只是帮助你开发的更容易而已，所以不要担心。

我比较熟悉人工智能和web开发。

以这个两个领域为例，经常有很多你可以选择的技术栈。

比如深度学习是用TensorFlow还是用PyTorch，或者是用一些更小众的，例如paddlepaddle，华为的mindspore等等。

web开发类似，你用react，还是angular，还是国内更常用的vue。

往往一些人，主要是刚入门的人，还有部分工作两三年的人，会很纠结技术栈的选择。

从这条信息来说，它是想告诉我们，技术栈的选择真的不是很重要。

先说一个侧面证据：

1、技术栈不是一成不变的。例如TensorFlow从1.0版本升级到2.0版本，变化非常的大。而web开发的angular，也是从1.0版本升级到2.0和后续版本，差别非常的大。

大到如同不是一个框架或技术栈一样。

但是它们的本质实际上并没有改变，只是通过变化不同的思路，来让你在实际工作中更容易的运用开发，缺点是，它造成了重复学习的成本。

不过与未来应用时所能节省的时间相比，这种成本其实是非常小的。

2、技术栈的核心是技术。

比如深度学习，其实你真正要理解的是，输入输出有什么样的关联，为什么他们能实现模型。而不是具体的代码如何写，代码如何写是非常细节的，就好像某个字典里面的字不会写，只要查字典就行了，而你知道那里有个字，才是最重要的。

还比如web，你需要理解web的本质是什么，为什么我们用html，为什么css，为什么从sir tim bernerce lee发明web到现在，它的本质其实没有改变。

最终，战胜恐惧的唯一办法是面对它。

相信我，只要你还在这个领域内继续工作，或者说，你想要在这个领域工作的很好，总是需要了解所有的技术栈的。

实际上通过对比不同的技术栈，你可以非常容易了解技术的本质，确实需要更多的时间，但是进行这样的学习和思考会帮助你太高你的职业天花板。

你想，大家都在用不同的方法来实现一个事儿，那他们肯定有相似性，那些相似性的东西，就是核心，是无法脱离的，而更多的区别，其实是一些细节上，或思路上的，并不是核心。

回过头来说，我们能否真的写出，最开始说的每个领域的十几个原则呢，很难。

就算写出来了，其实你也不一定理解，反而最好的学习方法，就是学习所有框架，自己思考、对比、实践。

前两天微博上看到有人提到，写好代码的唯一办法，就是写很多很多的烂代码。

3.	There's a reason why people recommend job hunting. If I'm unsatisfied at a job, it's probably time to move on.


4.	I've made some good, lifelong friends at companies I've worked with. I don't need to make that a requirement of every place I work. I've been perfectly happy working at places where I didn't form friendships with my coworkers and I've been unhappy at places where I made some great friends.

5.	I've learned to be honest with my manager. Not too honest, but honest enough where I can be authentic at work. What's the worse that can happen? He fire me? I'll just pick up a new job in 2 weeks.


6.	If I'm awaken at 2am from being on-call for more than once per quarter, then something is seriously wrong and I will either fix it or quit.

7.	pour another glass


8.	Qualities of a good manager share a lot of qualities of a good engineer.

9.	When I first started, I was enamored with technology and programming and computer science. I'm over it.


10.	Good code is code that can be understood by a junior engineer. Great code can be understood by a first year CS freshman. The best code is no code at all.

11.	The most underrated skill to learn as an engineer is how to document. Fuck, someone please teach me how to write good documentation. Seriously, if there's any recommendations, I'd seriously pay for a course (like probably a lot of money, maybe 1k for a course if it guaranteed that I could write good docs.)


12.	Related to above, writing good proposals for changes is a great skill.

13.	Almost every holy war out there (vim vs emacs, mac vs linux, whatever) doesn't matter... except one. See below.


14.	The older I get, the more I appreciate dynamic languages. Fuck, I said it. Fight me.

15.	If I ever find myself thinking I'm the smartest person in the room, it's time to leave.


16.	I don't know why full stack webdevs are paid so poorly. No really, they should be paid like half a mil a year just base salary. Fuck they have to understand both front end AND back end AND how different browsers work AND networking AND databases AND caching AND differences between web and mobile AND omg what the fuck there's another framework out there that companies want to use? Seriously, why are webdevs paid so little.

17.	We should hire more interns, they're awesome. Those energetic little fucks with their ideas. Even better when they can question or criticize something. I love interns.


18.	Sip

19.	Don't meet your heroes. I paid 5k to take a course by one of my heroes. He's a brilliant man, but at the end of it I realized that he's making it up as he goes along like the rest of us.


20.	Tech stack matters. OK I just said tech stack doesn't matter, but hear me out. If you hear Python dev vs C++ dev, you think very different things, right? That's because certain tools are really good at certain jobs. If you're not sure what you want to do, just do Java. It's a shitty programming language that's good at almost everything.

21.	The greatest programming language ever is lisp. I should learn lisp.


22.	For beginners, the most lucrative programming language to learn is SQL. Fuck all other languages. If you know SQL and nothing else, you can make bank. Payroll specialtist? Maybe 50k. Payroll specialist who knows SQL? 90k. Average joe with organizational skills at big corp? $40k. Average joe with organization skills AND sql? Call yourself a PM and earn $150k.

23.	Tests are important but TDD is a damn cult.


24.	Cushy government jobs are not what they are cracked up to be, at least for early to mid-career engineers. Sure, $120k + bennies + pension sound great, but you'll be selling your soul to work on esoteric proprietary technology. Much respect to government workers but seriously there's a reason why the median age for engineers at those places is 50+. Advice does not apply to government contractors.

25.	Third party recruiters are leeches. However, if you find a good one, seriously develop a good relationship with them. They can help bootstrap your career. How do you know if you have a good one? If they've been a third party recruiter for more than 3 years, they're probably bad. The good ones typically become recruiters are large companies.


26.	Options are worthless or can make you a millionaire. They're probably worthless unless the headcount of engineering is more than 100. Then maybe they are worth something within this decade.

27.	Work from home is the tits. But lack of whiteboarding sucks.


28.	I've never worked at FAANG so I don't know what I'm missing. But I've hired (and not hired) engineers from FAANGs and they don't know what they're doing either.

29.	My self worth is not a function of or correlated with my total compensation. Capitalism is a poor way to determine self-worth.


30.	Managers have less power than you think. Way less power. If you ever thing, why doesn't Manager XYZ fire somebody, it's because they can't.

31.	Titles mostly don't matter. Principal Distinguished Staff Lead Engineer from Whatever Company, whatever. What did you do and what did you accomplish. That's all people care about.


32.	Speaking of titles: early in your career, title changes up are nice. Junior to Mid. Mid to Senior. Senior to Lead. Later in your career, title changes down are nice. That way, you can get the same compensation but then get an increase when you're promoted. In other words, early in your career (<10 years), title changes UP are good because it lets you grow your skills and responsibilities. Later, title changes down are nice because it lets you grow your salary.

33.	Max out our 401ks.


34.	Be kind to everyone. Not because it'll help your career (it will), but because being kind is rewarding by itself.

35.	If I didn't learn something from the junior engineer or intern this past month, I wasn't paying attention.


36.	Oops I'm out of wine.

37.	Paying for classes, books, conferences is worth it. I've done a few conferences, a few 1.5k courses, many books, and a subscription. Worth it. This way, I can better pretend what I'm doing.


38.	Seriously, why aren't webdevs paid more? They know everything!!!

39.	Carpal tunnel and back problems are no joke. Spend the 1k now on good equipment.


40.	The smartest man I've every worked for was a Math PhD. I've learned so much from that guy. I hope he's doing well.

41.	Once, in high school, there was thing girl who was a great friend of mine. I mean we talked and hung out and shared a lot of personal stuff over a few years. Then there was a rumor that I liked her or that we were going out or whatever. She didn't take that too well so she started to ignore me. That didn't feel too good. I guess this would be the modern equivalent to "ghosting". I don't wish her any ill will though, and I hope she's doing great. I'm sorry I didn't handle that better.


42.	I had a girlfriend in 8th grade that I didn't want to break up with even though I didn't like her anymore so I just started to ignore her. That was so fucked up. I'm sorry, Lena.

43.	You know what the best part of being a software engineer is? You can meet and talk to people who think like you. Not necessarily the same interests like sports and TV shows and stuff. But they think about problems the same way you think of them. That's pretty cool.


44.	There's not enough women in technology. What a fucked up industry. That needs to change. I've been trying to be more encouraging and helpful to the women engineers in our org, but I don't know what else to do.

45.	Same with black engineers. What the hell?


46.	I've never really started hating a language or technology until I started becoming intimately familiar with it. Also, I think a piece of tech is good if I hate it but I simultaneously would recommend it to a client. Fuck Jenkins but man I don't think I would be commuting software malpractice by recommending it to a new client.

47.	That being said, git is awful and I have choice but to use it. Also, GUI git tools can go to hell, give me the command line any day. There's like 7 command lines to memorize, everything else can be googled.


48.	Since I work in data, I'm going to give a data-specific lessons learned. Fuck pandas.

49.	My job is easier because I have semi-technical analysts on my team. Semi-technical because they know programming but not software engineering. This is a blessing because if something doesn't make sense to them, it means that it was probably badly designed. I love the analysts on the team; they've helped me grow so much more than the most brilliant engineers.


50.	Dark mode is great until you're forced to use light mode (webpage or an unsupported app). That's why I use light mode.

51.	I know enough about security to know that I don't know shit about security.


52.	Crap I'm out of wine.

53.	Being a good engineer means knowing best practices. Being a senior engineer means knowing when to break best practices.


54.	If people are trying to assign blame to a bug or outage, it's time to move on.

55.	A lot of progressive companies, especially startups, talk about bringing your "authentic self". Well what if your authentic self is all about watching porn? Yeah, it's healthy to keep a barrier between your work and personal life.


56.	I love drinking with my co-workers during happy hour. I'd rather spend time with kids, family, or friends.

57.	The best demonstration of great leadership is when my leader took the fall for a mistake that was 100% my fault. You better believe I would've walked over fire for her.


58.	On the same token, the best leaders I've been privileged to work under did their best to both advocate for my opinions and also explain to me other opinions 'that conflict with mine. I'm working hard to be like them.

59.	Fuck side projects. If you love doing them, great! Even if I had the time to do side-projects, I'm too damn busy writing drunken posts on reddit


60.	Algorithms and data strictures are important--to a point. I don't see pharmacist interviews test trivia about organic chemistry. There's something fucked with our industry's interview process.

61.	Damn, those devops guys and gals are f'ing smart. At least those mofos get paid though.


62.	It's not important to do what I like. It's more important to do what I don't hate.

63.	The closer I am to the product, the closer I am to driving revnue, the more I feel valued regardless of how technical my work is. This has been true for even the most progressive companies.


64.	Linux is important even when I was working in all Windows. Why? Because I eventually worked in Linux. So happy for those weekend where I screwed around installing Arch.

65.	I've learned to be wary for ambiguous buzz words like big data. WTF is "big" data? I've dealt with 10k rows streaming every 10 minutes in Spark and Kafka and dealt with 1B rows batched up hourly in Python and MySQL. Those labels can go fuck themselves.


66.	Not all great jobs are in Silicon Valley. But a lot are.
